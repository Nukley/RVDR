This project is no longer able to be supported, as ROBLOX has recently cleared their setup.roblox.com builds, which is what this downloaded from...

I am going to push my latest changes and put the latest build as a release for anybody to download.

Yes, I know the code would be partially broken, if the download source was still active , and yes, I know my code is an absolute mess. 

Most of this is due to the fact this was an incomplete update, and was never ready for the public. 

But now, since the download source is gone for good, I give you this, as my special gift, the gift of software that does absolutely nothing.








If there is ever a day that setup.roblox.com gets its builds restored, I will continue my work on this, but for now, its just useless.

The latest release was going to:
support more years
download more files
and not require (but still would be completely compatible with) the batch file

If you decide to download, let me just say I hope you enjoy your virtual paperweight.
