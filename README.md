This project is no longer able to be supported, as ROBLOX has recently cleared their setup.roblox.com builds, which is what this downloaded from...<br/>
Here are my latest changes, and the latest build, uploaded as a release for anybody to download.<br/>

Yes, I know the code would be partially broken, if the download source was still active , and yes, I know my code is an absolute mess.<br/>
Most of this is due to the fact this was an incomplete update, and was never ready for the public.<br/>
But now, since the download source is gone for good, I give you this, as my special gift, the gift of software that does absolutely nothing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If there is ever a day that setup.roblox.com gets its builds restored, I will continue my work on this, but for now, its just useless.

The latest release was going to:<br/>
support more years<br/>
download more files<br/>
and not require (but still would be completely compatible with) the batch file<br/>

If you decide to download, let me just say I hope you enjoy your virtual paperweight.
